# Cancer Prediction PROJECT

#  Overview of Cancer Prediction
   Cancer prediction involves the use of various methods, particularly machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), to assess the likelihood of developing cancer, 
   the risk of recurrence, and overall survivability. This field has gained significant traction due to advancements in data analysis techniques and the availability of 
   large datasets.

#  Key Focus Areas in Cancer Prediction
  1 Cancer Susceptibility : This aspect focuses on predicting the likelihood of an individual developing cancer based on genetic and environmental factors.
  2 Cancer Recurrence : After treatment, predicting the chances of cancer returning is crucial for patient management.
  3 Survivability : Assessing life expectancy and treatment responses post-diagnosis is essential for tailoring patient care.

#  Machine Learning Techniques in Cancer Prediction

* Machine learning has revolutionized cancer prediction by improving accuracy and providing insights that traditional statistical methods may overlook.
  
  a) Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs): Commonly used for their ability to model complex relationships within data.

  b) Decision Trees (DTs): Useful for classification tasks, including risk assessment.

  c) Random Forest Classifier: Known for its high accuracy in detecting various cancers.

  d) Support Vector Machines (SVM): Effective in classifying cancer types based on feature subsets.

#  Challenges in Cancer Prediction

   * Data Imbalance: Many studies face issues with an imbalance between predictive events and parameters, leading to less reliable models.
  
   * Overfitting: Complex models may perform well on training data but fail to generalize to new cases.
  
   * Validation: A lack of external validation in many studies raises concerns about the applicability of findings in real-world settings.
